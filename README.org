*  Modified in 2024 for Centos 9 and RHEL 9 distro's (not tested on RHEL 8) 
** The original author was https://github.com/penguin2716/autoinstall_cloudstack

* What is this?

  This is an easy installation script for CloudStack 4.x.
  This script automates installation on a fresh CentOS 9.x node by using minimal install.
  All you have to do is running this script with options '-canm'.
  After a while you will see welcome message on the CloudStack web UI.

  This script also saves installation steps of CloudStack on multiple nodes
  with Management Servers, Computing Nodes and Storage Servers.

* How to use

 : **** comment out the section for webmin in the script if you have no use for it. ****

  Download this script into wherever you like on the server that CloudStack will be installed.
  When you run this script with '-h'(help) optoin, you will see available options for the script.
  : ./autoinstall_cloudstack.sh -h

** Options
     | Option | Function                              |
     | -c     | install the common packages           |
     | -n     | install NFS server                    |
     | -a     | install the agent for computing nodes |
     | -m     | install the Management Server         |
     | -h     | show help                             |
     | -r     | reboot after the installation         |
     Usage:
       - '-cm': when you want to install only the management server
       - '-cn': when you want to install only the NFS server
       - '-ca': when you want to install only the agent for computing nodes
     The '-c'(common) option will set SELinux to permissive, firewall and network.

     Installing CloudStack on single node, type command below:
     : bash autoinstall_cloudstack.sh -cnamr

     Installing just the CloudStack Agent on a node, type command below:
     : bash autoinstall_cloudstack.sh -car

** Tips
  - You may need to install 'wget' or 'openssh-clients' package with yum command before downloading this script.
  - If you want to save time to input credentials to login by SSH, enter the ssh public key of your client machine to SSH_PUBLIC_KEY at the 3rd line of the script (optional).

* Concerns
  This script sets up the network for CloudStack requirements automatically, and it may works only on servers with 1 NIC. 

  This script sets up network bridges as:
  : # brctl show
  : bridge name bridge id               STP enabled     interfaces
  : cloud0      8000.fe00a9fe0074       no              vnet0
  :                                                     vnet3
  : cloudbr0    8000.80ee733704b5       no              eth0
  :                                                     vnet1
  :                                                     vnet2
  :                                                     vnet4
  :                                                     vnet5
  :                                                     vnet6
  : virbr0      8000.52540079e395       yes             virbr0-nic
